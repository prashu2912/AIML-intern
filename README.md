# 🦉 AI/ML Research Internship Portfolio | Owl AI

## 📌 Executive Summary
This repository documents the projects and research completed during my **AI/ML Research Internship** at **Owl AI**. The work spans the full machine learning lifecycle—from theoretical research on Large Language Models (LLMs) and role analysis to practical implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and comparative model engineering.

## 📂 Project Modules

### **Task 1: The AI/ML Researcher Role**
* **Objective:** Analyzed the core responsibilities, toolchains, and strategic importance of AI/ML Researchers in the modern tech ecosystem.
* **Deliverable:** A comprehensive 3-page research document including a specialized Q&A section demonstrating industry awareness.
* **Key Insight:** The role has evolved from pure academic research to a hybrid of engineering and experimentation, requiring proficiency in both PyTorch/TensorFlow and business strategy.

### **Task 2: Large Language Models (LLMs)**
* **Objective:** Conducted a deep-dive technical analysis of state-of-the-art models including **ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Claude**.
* **Deliverable:** A 5-page research paper exploring Transformer architectures, "Agentic" workflows, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and the ethical frontiers of AI.
* **Key Insight:** The industry is shifting from generative chatbots to **autonomous agents** capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows.

### **Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Objective:** Uncovered patterns and relationships in high-dimensional data using statistical techniques.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
* **Deliverable:** A Jupyter Notebook visualization report identifying key trends, outliers, and data correlations in a real-world dataset.

### **Task 4: Machine Learning Model Comparison**
* **Objective:** Engineered and evaluated supervised learning models to solve a predictive problem.
* **Methodology:** Benchmarked **Linear Regression** vs. **Random Forest** algorithms.
* **Metrics:** Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
* **Deliverable:** A comparative analysis showcasing the trade-offs between model interpretability (Linear) and predictive power (Ensemble methods).
